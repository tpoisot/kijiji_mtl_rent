# Rent prices in the greater Montréal area

This project will download a bunch of kijiji ads for flats in the greater
Montréal area. It is a nodejs app, to run with `node kijiji.js`. The listings
are returned as a `json` file (`kijiji.json`).

It is moderately useful to teach decision trees and other classifiers.
